# AS91896

## Installation
Dependencies found in [pipfile](Pipfile)

## Running
Because of the fact that QtDesigner is really stupid, you have to run the [main.py](bingo/main.py) file from the ui directory ([bingo/src/ui](bingo/src/ui)). If you do not run the script from here the GUI resources will not load and it won't look good.

i.e. run `python ../main.py` from [bingo/src/ui](bingo/src/ui) with the correct dependencies installed
